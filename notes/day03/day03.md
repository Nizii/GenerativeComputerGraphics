### My sketch

### I had some problem with the rotation of the text symbols...

### ...so i changed my concept...

### ...and here is the result
The small rectangel in the middle rotate every milli second. The second smallest just every second and so it goes with minutes and the biggest rectangel rotates every hour. The clock has no clock digits.
