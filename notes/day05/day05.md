## Faces

My program draws different smilies. 
The smilies are generated randomly and have different facial expressions. For the shape of the head I programmed a circle made up of smaller circles. In order to bring in something irregular, I randomized the radius for a certain range for the shape of the head. 
The picture is only drawn from circles, except for the mouth I have used rectangles, lines and circles.

Here are some results.
